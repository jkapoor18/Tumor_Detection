Welcome to our Brain Tumor Detection project! 🧠🔍

## About the Project

Early detection of brain tumors can make a significant difference in patients' lives. Our project aims to leverage the power of machine learning and medical imaging to assist healthcare professionals in detecting brain tumors accurately and swiftly.

## Key Features

- 🖼️ **Image Classification:** Our model can classify brain MRI images into two categories: "No Brain Tumor" and "Brain Tumor Detected."
- 🚀 **Real-time Detection:** Deploy our model for real-time tumor detection, making it invaluable for medical professionals.
- 📈 **High Accuracy:** We've fine-tuned our model to ensure high accuracy in tumor detection.

## How to Use

1. Upload a brain MRI image.
2. Let our powerful model analyze the image.
3. Receive instant results - whether a brain tumor is detected or not.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions from the open-source community and medical professionals. Join us in our mission to save lives through early tumor detection. Your expertise can make a difference.
